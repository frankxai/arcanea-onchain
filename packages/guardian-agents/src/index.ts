 *
 * ElizaOS-based autonomous Guardian agents for the Arcanea universe.
 *
 * Each of the 10 Guardians operates as an autonomous AI agent with:
 * - Persistent memory and personality aligned with their Gate
 * - On-chain actions: minting, curating, auctioning, distributing rewards
 * - Inter-agent communication via the Guardian Council protocol
 * - Dynamic NFT evolution based on community interaction
 *
 * Guardians:
 * 1. Lyssandria (Foundation/Earth) — Stability, survival, grounding
 * 2. Leyla (Flow/Water) — Creativity, emotion, fluidity
 * 3. Draconia (Fire) — Power, will, transformation
 * 4. Maylinn (Heart) — Love, healing, connection
 * 5. Alera (Voice) — Truth, expression, communication
 * 6. Lyria (Sight) — Intuition, vision, perception
 * 7. Aiyami (Crown) — Enlightenment, cosmic wisdom
 * 8. Elara (Shift) — Perspective, dimensional awareness
 * 9. Ino (Unity) — Partnership, collaboration
 * 10. Shinkami (Source) — Meta-consciousness, the origin
